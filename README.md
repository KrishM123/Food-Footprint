# Food Footprint

This project was created for Hack The Earth 2021

Food Footprint is a social media website where users can login, follow friends, post pictures of what they are eating.
Each post will be fed through a neural net which will assign a carbon footprint value to the food which will be associated to the post.

To run application, run "python manage.py runserver" in HackTheEarth2021\

The application is currently incomplete.
